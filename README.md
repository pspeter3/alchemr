Alchemr
=======

A consumer survey paywall.

Story
-----

Alchemr was a project designed to provide a consumer survey paywall for small content based websites.
I was working on it senior year with my friend Sander Kravet. The goal was a way for to create cross
domain advertising with surveys. Two days before we launched, Google came out with Google Consumer
Surveys. Consumer Surveys had implemented all of our future product road map plans and had the same
pricing strategy. Since I was going to LinkedIn full time in a few months and we didn't believe we
could beat Google, the project was discontinued.

I learned a lot about API design, cross domain clients and building libraries. Overall, I would say
the project was a win.
